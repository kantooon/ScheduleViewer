<h3>ScheduleViewer Help</h3>
<b>Basic usage:</b><br/>
<p><b>Important:</b> You must first edit the <b>Settings</b> (Edit -> Settings menu) and enter the path of your FGFS data directory. This is required for livery checking and aircraft conf exporting.</p>
<i>Import schedules in *.conf format:</i>
<p>
Go to <b>File -> Import</b> and choose the path (directory) where to look for conf files.
Leave empty the <b>Depth level</b> field to look only in this directory. Enter a number in this field to make
the import tool search all directories <b>below</b> the selected one, at the level you give via this number.
For example, if you enter <b>1</b>, the import tool will look in all subdirectories of the specified path, but <b>not</b> in the specified directory, or in any subdirectories nested at a depth greater than 1.<br/>This is usefull if you have cloned the AI schedule repository, and you want to scan all directories of airlines it includes, without scanning the root directory or the subdirectories which contain separate files for each airline resulting from a common PDF timetable.
</p>
<br/>
<i>Export schedules from the database in *.conf format</i>
<p>
Go to <b>File -> Export</b> and choose the path (directory where the conf files will be written), then check the <b>Separate airlines</b> to write separate files for each airline (default option). Uncheck to write all flights in the same file (flights.conf or view.conf).
By default the export directory is <b>exported_flights</b> under the main application directory.
<br/>
Next choose which flight schedules will be exported: all flights in the current view (table being displayed by filters), only flights selected by you, or the whole database of flight schedules. 
</p>
<br/>
<i>Using the <b>Filter query tool</b> window</i>
<p>
The <b>Filters</b> help you display flight schedules that fulfill your criteria.
<br/>
In the filter fields, enter airport, time, type or airline and click <b>Show</b>. The airport names are standard ICAO, the airline names are standard ICAO, and the aircraft type are standard IATA. Times are format <b>HH:MM</b>. The day is a number from 0 to 6, with 0 being Sunday.
The search is case insensitive.
<br/>
<b>"Smart"</b> filters are available for the <i>callsign, departure time, departure day, arrival time, arrival day</i> fields. To use them, input only part of the string you want to search for, like for instance <b>10:</b>, which will fetch all flights with departing hour 10, or <b>:30</b> which will fetch all flights departing at hour:30 minutes. This is the case for the day too, if you want to search for flights that take place on Sunday but not on Monday, you would enter <b>0.</b> - notice the dot after 0. The callsign can also be entered partially, for instance <b>SpeedBird</b> which will fetch BAW flights.
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> For readability and display reasons, the dots from <b>Departure day</b> have been replaced with <b>#</b> or <b>-</b>. When editing, you should enter the same character as is being displayed, it will be converted to dots automatically inside the database. The filter field accepts only dots as substitute for days.
<br/>
To clear the table view and the filter form, click <b>Clear</b>.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Empty database</b> button truncates the Flights database table, leaving an empty slate. Use with care.
</p>
<p>
You can select multiple flights at the same time with CTRL and SHIFT to delete. The Del key is a shortcut for the delete button. You will not be asked again so be carefull.<br/>
Double click a table field to edit it, when you are finished press <b>Enter</b>.
</p>
<p>To add a new flight, enter the flight information in the filter fields, then press <b>Add flight</b>. Thorough input checking is not yet implemented so be careful.
</p>
<p>In the <i>Aircraft</i> tab, the button <b>Add missing aircraft</b> will trigger a database check for all aircraft types present in the flight schedules table, and add those missing into the table <i>aircraft</i>.
</p>
<p>Fleet designation column color coding: <b>GREEN</b>=model livery was found in FGDATA path; <b>RED</b>=model livery was not found. If all entries in the <i>Designation</i> column are red, check you FGDATA path in the <b>settings</b> file. It is most likely wrong.
</p>
<p>The <b>Generate aircraft conf</b> button on the fleet tab lets you export aircraft .conf for the selected airline or all airlines with fleets. To generate only one airline, you must have a valid airline entered in the <b>Airline</b> field. If your FGDATA path is not set correctly in the <b>settings</b> file, there will be no valid model liveries and export will fail.
</p>
<p>The <b>Generate flight plans</b> button on the fleet tab lets you export flightplans in XML format for the selected airline or all airlines. To generate only one airline, you must have a valid airline entered in the <b>Airline</b> field. If your FGDATA path is not set correctly in the <b>settings</b> file, there will be no valid model liveries and export will probably fail.
</p>
<h4>Known issues:</h4>
If you order the table by a column other than id and then apply filters, the table will be corrupted. To solve this, simply order by id again, click <b>Show</b> then order by the column you want. The table will display normally.
