<h3>ScheduleViewer Help</h3>
<b>Basic usage:</b><br/>
<p><b>Important:</b> You must first edit the <b>Settings</b> (Edit -> Settings menu) and enter the path of your FGFS data directory. This is required for livery checking and aircraft conf exporting.<br/>
You may also select the checkbox to move flightplans to FGDATA directory as soon as they are generated, but be very careful, unless you know exactly what you are doing, as you may overwrite existing flightplans.<br/>
To preview the aircraft models / liveries, you should also provide the path to the FGViewer binary, which is typically the same as the location of the FGFS binary.
</p>
<i>Import schedules in *.conf format:</i>
<p>
<i>The program is not capable yet of importing aircraft confs (or lines beginning with AC). For now, use only the fleets and aircraft types for that purpose</i>
Go to <b>File -> Import</b> and choose the path (directory) where to look for conf files.
Leave empty the <b>Depth level</b> field to look only in this directory. Enter a number in this field to make
the import tool search all directories <b>below</b> the selected one, at the level you give via this number.
For example, if you enter <b>1</b>, the import tool will look in all subdirectories of the specified path, but <b>not</b> in the specified directory, or in any subdirectories nested at a depth greater than 1.<br/>This is usefull if you have cloned the AI schedule repository, and you want to scan all directories of airlines it includes, without scanning the root directory or the subdirectories which contain separate files for each airline resulting from a common PDF timetable.
</p>
<br/>
<i>Export schedules from the database in *.conf format</i>
<p>
Go to <b>File -> Export</b> and choose the path (directory where the conf files will be written), then check the <b>Separate airlines</b> to write separate files for each airline (default option). Uncheck to write all flights in the same file (flights.conf or view.conf).
By default the export directory is <b>exported_flights</b> under the main application directory.
<br/>
Next choose which flight schedules will be exported: all flights in the current view (table being displayed by filters), only flights selected by you, or the whole database of flight schedules. 
</p>
<br/>
<b>Data organisation</b>
<p>There are two top-level tabs: <b>Data</b> contains the flight schedule and aircraft information which is used to generate the Flightgear AI flightplans; <b>Fleet info</b> contains meta-data for airline fleets, which is used to construct the aircraft information from the <b>Data</b> tab.<br/>
</p>
<br/>
<i>Using the <b>Filter query tool</b> window</i>
<p>
The <b>Filters</b> help you display flight schedules that fulfill your criteria.
<br/>
In the filter fields, enter airport, time, type or airline and click <b>Show</b>. The airport names are standard ICAO, the airline names are standard ICAO, and the aircraft type are standard IATA. Times are format <b>HH:MM</b>. The day is a number from 0 to 6, with 0 being Sunday.
The search is case insensitive.
<br/>
<b>"Smart"</b> filters are available for the <i>callsign, departure time, departure day, arrival time, arrival day</i> fields. To use them, input only part of the string you want to search for, like for instance <b>10:</b>, which will fetch all flights with departing hour 10, or <b>:30</b> which will fetch all flights departing at hour:30 minutes. This is the case for the day too, if you want to search for flights that take place on Sunday but not on Monday, you would enter <b>0.</b> - notice the dot after 0. The callsign can also be entered partially, for instance <b>SpeedBird</b> which will fetch BAW flights.
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> For readability and display reasons, the dots from <b>Departure day</b> have been replaced with <b>#</b> or <b>_</b>. When editing, you should enter the same character as is being displayed, it will be converted to dots automatically inside the database. The filter field accepts only dots as substitute for days.
<br/>
To clear the table view and the filter form, click <b>Clear</b>.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Empty flights table</b> button truncates the Flights database table, leaving an empty slate. It will also destroy the duplicate flight index table. Use with care.
</p>
<i>Duplicate filtering</i>
<p>
The <b>Create duplicate index</b> button can be used to create a database table containing an index of obvious duplicate flights found in the flights database. If you have entered an airline code in the <b>Airline</b> field, the operation will only be performed on flights of this airline, else it will be performed on all flights in the database. Depending on the total number of flights stored in the database, this operation can take a long time to complete (typically more than one hour). After it has been completed, the flights marked as duplicates will appear in shades of red anytime a search is performed. Depending on how many days are duplicated for this flight, the shade of red varies from darker to lighter. This operation is only necessary after you have imported new conf files.<br/>
Limitations: the duplicate indexing is only performed on flights with the same airline code. If there are airlines with multiple codes in the database, duplicate indexing will not take those into account.
</p>
<p>
You can select multiple flights at the same time with CTRL and SHIFT to delete. The Del key is a shortcut for the delete button. You will not be asked again so be carefull.<br/>
Double click a table field to edit it, when you are finished press <b>Enter</b>.
</p>
<p><b>Deleting duplicates</b>: pressing this button will open a prompt asking for a treshhold. This represents the duplicate score assigned by checking the number of days one flight has in common with other flights. The score will be maximum (7) when all days are duplicated in other flight entries, thus making the duplicated flight completely safe to delete. The number you must enter cannot be lower than 1 or higher than 7. To delete all duplicate entries in the database, regardless of the number of duplicated days, enter 1. To keep all flights that are not duplicated anywhere, enter 7.
</p>
<p>To add a new flight, enter the flight information in the filter fields, then press <b>Add flight</b>. Thorough input checking is not yet implemented so be careful.
</p>
<p>The <b>Find hubs</b> function will open a new window containing airport and flights number statistics. The airports with most flights will be displayed at the top, in descending order. The only filter options available for this function are airline and aircraft type.
</p>
<p>The <b>Find aircraft types</b> function will open a new window containing aircraft ICAO type codes and flights number statistics. The aircraft with most flights will be displayed at the top, in descending order. For this function to work you must specify an airline code in the filter field.
</p>
<p>In the <i>Aircraft types</i> tab, the button <b>Add missing aircraft</b> will trigger a database check for all aircraft types present in the flight schedules table, and add those missing into the table <i>aircraft</i>.
</p>
<p>Fleet designation column color coding: <b>GREEN</b>=model livery was found in FGDATA path; <b>RED</b>=model livery was not found. If all entries in the <i>Designation</i> column are red, check you FGDATA path in the <b>settings</b> file. It is most likely wrong.
</p>
<p>The <b>Generate aircraft table</b> button on the Airline fleets tab lets you populate the aircraft table for the selected airline or all airlines with fleets. To generate only one airline, you must have a valid airline entered in the <b>Airline</b> field. Once that table is populated, you can review the information on the Aircraft tab.
</p>
<p>The <b>Preview model</b> button on the Airline fleets tab lets you visualise the aspect of the selected model within a FGViewer window. You must have only one fleet entry selected in the airline fleets table, and also have the FGViewer binary path enterd correctly in the <b>Settings</b>. The shortcut for preview is the key <b>P</b>.
</p>
<p>The <b>Generate aircraft conf</b> button on the Aircraft tab lets you export aircraft .conf for the selected airline or all airlines with fleets. To generate only one airline, you must have a valid airline entered in the <b>Airline</b> field. If your FGDATA path is not set correctly in the <b>settings</b> file, there will be no valid model liveries and export will fail.
</p>
<p>The <b>Generate flight plans</b> button on the Aircraft tab lets you export flightplans in XML format for the selected airline or all airlines. To generate only one airline, you must have a valid airline entered in the <b>Airline</b> field. If your FGDATA path is not set correctly in the <b>settings</b> file, there will be no valid model liveries and export will probably fail. If you have checked the <b>"move flightplans"</b> checkbox, the generated files will be copied directly to FGDATA. Exercise extreme caution, as this operation is likely to overwrite any existing flightplans.
</p>
<h4>Known issues:</h4>
The program can't import aircraft confs or lines starting with AC from mixed confs.
